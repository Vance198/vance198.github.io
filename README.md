# References and Templates
- I used W3school to learn HTML and CSS, and used
the basic HTML/CSS template
- I used the agile development process and sprints over
three days. First Day was to learn and familiarize myself
with HTML/CSS. Second Day was to code all the texts, and add
all the files, images, and icons. Third day was used for design.


# Description
- I wanted to keep my portfolio very simple and minimalistic. I
was thinking from a employer perspective, and if I am last on the list
of applicants, I want them to have everything they need within one page and
without having them to go through a bulk of text to find what they need. 
There are some stuff I will implement and change once I gain more experience, like adding projects that are worthy of showing.
